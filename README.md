# Binance-Futures-OHLCV-Extractor: An AI-Accelerated Development Showcase

This repository serves as a practical case study in Prompt Engineering and AI Fluency, demonstrating the power of Human-AI Collaboration for the accelerated development of robust financial tools. It embodies a structured approach to Prompt Framework Architecture Designâ€”a core focus of this portfolioâ€”for creating high-utility software tailored for individual and large-scale investors.

At its core, the project is a robust Python utility designed for extracting historical Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) candlestick data from the Binance USDT-M Futures API and saving it to clean, ready-to-use CSV files.

This tool is engineered for high reliability, featuring an automated fallback to direct REST API calls if the official Binance connector library is not installed or fails, ensuring maximum data retrieval stability for your Quantitative Finance and Machine Learning projects.

## ðŸ’¡ Prompt Engineering & AI Fluency: The Development Framework

This project was developed using a **structured Human-AI collaborative process**, designed to validate expertise in **Prompt Engineering** and the rapid development of functional software components, specifically focusing on **data pipeline automation**.

The core of this methodology relies on a **Hierarchical Prompt Architecture** that systematically breaks down the complex goal (automated data extraction and cleaning) into discrete, manageable sub-tasks.

### Framework Methodology: Layered Abstraction for Utility Design

| Layer | Objective | Key Prompt Strategy | Demonstration in Code Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Strategic Intent & Core Structure** | Define the overall Python utility, requiring it to be modular (using a function like `criptodata`), handle multiple assets, and utilize the official `python-binance` connector. | **System & Vision Prompt:** Used to establish the complete *flow* of the script: **Fetch $\rightarrow$ Process $\rightarrow$ Save**, ensuring the inclusion of an iteration loop (`for i in list:`). | Focus on establishing the `for` loop and the `criptodata(dataticker)` function signature for scalability. |
| **2. Data Processing Engineering** | Develop the required data manipulation steps: column selection (`df = df.iloc[:,:6]`), column renaming, *timestamp* conversion, and final type casting (`df = df.astype("float")`). | **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Requesting the AI to design the optimal **`pandas` pipeline** for cleaning raw `get_historical_klines` output, specifically detailing the conversion of Binance *milliseconds* to standard `datetime`. | Focus on generating the `.set_index("Date")` and `pd.to_datetime(df.index, unit="ms")` lines for accurate time series preparation. |
| **3. Utility Finalization & Output** | Implement the final saving mechanism and ensure that the process can handle a list of inputs efficiently. | **Refinement Prompt:** Submitting the function to the AI for adding the final output mechanism (`df.to_csv`) and validating that the entire logic is contained within a single, executable script (demonstrating rapid prototyping). | Ensuring the `dataticker + ".csv"` naming convention is implemented for dynamic file saving. |

This **AI-Accelerated Development** approach focused on **rapidly translating a data workflow idea into a functional Python *script***, demonstrating the efficiency of a well-defined prompt architecture over manually researching and writing the *boilerplate* code and data cleaning steps.

1.  **Translate Complex Financial Requirements** into modular, production-ready Python code via structured prompts (AI Fluency).
2.  **Architect Robust Code:** The tool is engineered for high reliability, featuring an automated fallback to direct REST API calls (using `requests`) if the official Binance connector library is unavailable or fails, ensuring maximum data retrieval stability.
3.  **Establish a Data Foundation** for advanced **Quantitative Finance** and **Machine Learning** projects by enforcing data quality standards (DatetimeIndex, Float types).

By focusing on prompt structure and iterative refinement, this repository validates a crucial workflow for **financial software engineers** operating in the AI-centric era.

## Features

- Fetch historical OHLCV (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) from Binance
  USDT-M futures public klines endpoint.
- Saves per-symbol CSV files (e.g. `BTCUSDT.csv`).
- Configurable start/end dates, list of tickers, timeframe and output folder.
- Graceful fallback if `binance-connector` is not installed.
- Robust pagination and rate-safety.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Environment Variables

While the klines (candlestick) endpoint is public and does not require authentication, the script includes logic to detect API keys for future extension (e.g., authenticated endpoints).

You can optionally set your environment variables for future use:

```bash
export BINANCE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="YOUR_API_SECRET"
```

# Usage

* Configure Tickers: Open the binance_futures_ohlcv_to_csv.py file and modify the DEFAULT_TICKERS list and START_DATE_STR as needed.
* Run the Script:

```bash
  python binance_futures_ohlcv_to_csv.py
```

# Output

* The script will create a directory named binance_futures_csvs/ in the execution path and save a separate CSV file for each processed ticker (e.g., BTCUSDT.csv, ETHUSDT.csv).
* Example CSV Output (BTCUSDT.csv):

```bash
Date	open	high	low	close	volume
2021-01-01 00:00:00	28935.91	29596.12	28935.91	29331.05	118228.012
2021-01-02 00:00:00	29330.93	33318.00	29285.00	32185.00	367297.435
...	...	...	...	...	...
```

# Quantitative Finance and Machine Learning Context

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD).
* **Time Series Modeling:** Applying models like ARIMA, GARCH, or more complex ML/DL models (LSTMs, Transformers) to predict future price movements.
* **Backtesting:** Simulating trading strategies over historical market conditions.
  
This extractor provides the necessary foundation for projects rooted in Financial Engineering, Discrete Models of Financial Markets, and Machine Learning for Time-Series, which require high-quality, standardized input data.

# Project Architecture & Code Breakdown

* The core script is designed to be modular and easy to maintain.

```bash
Function	Purpose
_ensure_api_keys()	Safely reads Binance API credentials from environment variables.
_to_millis(dt)	Converts Python datetime objects into Binance-required epoch milliseconds.
_parse_klines_response(klines)	Transforms the raw list-of-lists API response into a clean, indexed pandas.DataFrame.
_fetch_klines_requests(...)	Core Robustness Logic. Fetches data using the standard requests library, handling API endpoint parameters and necessary pagination (requesting data in chunks of MAX_LIMIT=1000).
_fetch_klines_connector(...)	An attempt to use the binance-connector library (if installed), providing a placeholder for potential higher-performance or authenticated retrieval.
criptodata(...)	Main Extraction Workflow. Manages the date conversion, executes the fetching (with connector/request fallback), and writes the final DataFrame to a CSV file.
